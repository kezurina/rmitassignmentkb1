	<p>The three tests were quite challenging to do. I kept having to stop and think about the statements they proposed and then consider my answer. Both the Myers-Briggs and the Test Partnership suggest that Iâ€™m the quiet one in the pack. I know from experience I sit and listen and need to be forced to answer questions but when it comes to practical stuff, I come into my own. I can organise lots of data and can determine an appropriate method of proceeding. I like dealing with lots of information. And quite honestly this is me to a tee. I try to keep all individuals in the team involved by asking them questions or asking them for help. I know I have difficulty thinking on the run, I need time to research and consider before I can provide an idea it is agony being pushed for an idea, but give me an idea and I will run with it and work hard to implement whatever the suggestion. In terms of Belbin Team Role theory, the most appropriate team roles for me would be Team Coordinator, Team Worker or Resource Investigator.</p>
