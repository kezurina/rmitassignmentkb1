<p>I love working with people. I thought I would enjoy teaching. But curriculum, time, parents, and students made me flounder and eventually leave. So, I got a job in a shop, guiding, advising, assisting customers in all things yarn; and helping the owner bring his business into modern times with social media, better stock control, a webpage and updated communications.</p>

The more I thought about the first week’s reading the idea that I could maybe work at becoming an IT professional as a business analyst. With this in mind, I looked for a specific job as a business analyst.



A business analyst responds to the goals and requirements, problems and needs of a business, and develops and facilitates a solution or solutions. The analyst works to translate each party’s need to the other. They are well versed in technology but can also help other departments identify their technological needs. The business analyst can be employed in-house and work as a consultant. It is vital that the Business Analyst be able to work thoughtfully and timely, creating a detailed business analysis which outlines problems, looks for opportunities and then can find solutions. 



<<p>strong>Skill Set required by the Business Analyst.</strong></p>
	
	<p> <em><p>Strong technological skills</em> – Knowing what hardware and software and being able to problem shoot during implementation is vital.</p>

      <em><p>Excellent communication skills</em> - needs to be able to talk with managers and employees and translate highly technical information to people. They may need to run workshops with groups of people, so being comfortable speaking to a group is essential. </p>

      <em><p>Strong problem-solving skills</em> – the ability to examine the problem from all angles taking into account all variable and then predicting other potential problems that may need to be looked at. They should be patient, methodical and be able to document operations, problems and solutions, succinctly but completely.
</p>
      <em><p>Critical thinking</em> – the ability to listen and hear why things are happening as they are, how or when problems are occurring, or what happens when a situation occurs. It needs methodical steps in order to gather all the information necessary.</p>

      <em><p>Projection and process modelling skills</em> – discussion using charts, graphs, diagrams may be used to display at meetings. Forward mapping is needed to adopt changes. Time management and scheduling is needed to ensure the solution is made with time limits.</p>

      <em<p>>Analytical skills</em> – need to be able to think about all aspects of the problem and solution. The mnemonic of PESTLE can be implemented to ensure all stakeholders are considered. P=political; E=economics; S=social; T=technological; L=legal; E=environment.</p>



      <strong>Qualifications generally needed by the Business Analyst </strong> <p>Depending on which institution is listing, the qualifications needed by the business analyst are:</p>

<ul>Degree in Business (administration, finance, accounting, or Information Technology); 

Work Experience

Master’s degree or advanced certificate </ul>



<p>Involved in my teaching was a great deal of work on documentation, reviewing past information and forward planning. I also have skills in communicating with various stakeholders and powerful skills in patience. I can speak before groups of people and can organise and run activities. Part of being an effective teacher is being able to identify problems and find solutions that engage and deliver success. I’ve had many years of juggling time commitments, meeting deadlines and ensuring all parties have what they need to succeed. I just now need the technology component.</p>
