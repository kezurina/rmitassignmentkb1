  <section id="sectionl"><p id="para">	Knowing from the well worn accrual of what I still call HECS, and that my desk resembles the bottom of a cockies cage, I am in no way comfortable with the use of technology at the level of this class and that potentially by census day I will have withdrawn yet another subject in my quest to find my interesting niche in the world. But it's worth looking at. Gosh some of these people in this class are really good at IT. I'm thinking WTF: I work in a small wool shop in Geelong and I have been thrust into the position of looking after the computer - email, facebook, website, online shop - and atm I'm all wide eyes and frantically thinking up possible solutions to the questions about online presence and how to promote us on the interweb, and making the website and facebook work for us.</p><p id="para">Tools! Okay, I know how to turn the computer off and on. I can check email. I can set up a simple website with Rapidweaver. Within five minutes I was lost in the bowels of Citrix, looking at a lovely and thoughtfully provided desktop from the Uni. And getting a little panicky that I have really taken on something mysterious and interesting and cool. How intriguing!</p></section><p id="para2">[Thinks the tutor is the same age as my kids, and they're predominately male, and they all work in IT already, oh wait..that’s a girl’s name….well at least there’s another girl….oh holy %^%$ she’s working in IT too…breathe….do the best you can….]</p><p id="para">Overview of Week 0…….I kept up. Posted a couple of things in the discussion forums. Feeling a little overwhelmed but i'm surprised that I'm finding this stuff really interesting.</p></section></div>
<div id="div1"><p><h3>Introduction - Week 1</h3></p><p><hr></p><p id="sectionl">Already I have noticed a difference in my approach to the computer. I laugh out loud when it does something unexpected rather than groan and go make a cup of tea. I have downloaded the Assignment and the rubrix and start straight at the guts, working through the Hello World introduction on GitHub. I'm starting to think I'm going to be in trouble if i have to code a website. Especially if I can't use a WYSIWYG. ...A couple of days later the tutor replies that I work on a document first then make the website.</p> <p id="para">In previous studies I would have been writing everything down. But using the computer is sooooooo much better. And as long as I keep everything in the one file and remember to copy all the sites I use, I should be okay.</p></div>

<div id="div2"><p><h3> - Week 2</h3></p><hr><p id="sectionl">OMG I'm actually having fun. I need to hand this website in soon, i.e. at the end of week three and I'm pretty certain the website will pass. I'm not sure about the content but the rubrix is a good standard to follow. It may not be pretty, but it works. I'm going to work the rest of the course on a blog format. But I'm thinking that I should work on that linking thingy after this is handed in. Anyway. Dreamweaver..I can kick your butt.</p><p id="para"> I'll leave this space so I can link the blog. </p></div><p><hr id="horiz"></p>
